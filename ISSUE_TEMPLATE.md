## Brief Reflection

This exercise was incredibly valuable for understanding the complete GitHub workflow. I learned how to:
- Work with multiple branches simultaneously
- Make focused, incremental commits
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Organize work across different feature branches

The practice helped solidify Git fundamentals and gave me hands-on experience with collaborative development workflows used in real-world projects.

## Request

Requesting review and approval to merge both feature branches:
- `feature/reezma-introduction`
- `feature/add-new-section`

Thank you for creating this learning opportunity!
