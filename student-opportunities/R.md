# GitHub Student Certification Voucher (Foundations or Copilot)

This document explains how verified students can request and use the GitHub certification voucher included in the Student Developer Pack. The voucher is valid for one exam attempt and can be applied to either the Foundations Exam or the Copilot Exam (not both).

## Important details

- Voucher window: the 2025â€“2026 vouchers expire on 2026-06-30.
- Usage: each voucher can be used once.
- Exam choice: voucher is valid for either the Foundations Exam or the Copilot Exam (not both).
- Certification records: certifications earned through PSI (before 2025-07-01) remain on GitHub Learn. Certifications earned through Pearson VUE (on or after 2025-07-01) will appear on Microsoft Learn.
- Badges: current exams issue badges through Microsoft Learn (not Credly).
- Rescheduling: cancel or reschedule at least 24 hours before the appointment to avoid forfeiting fees.
