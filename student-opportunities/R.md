The student voucher for GitHub certifications returns to the Student Developer Pack Tuesday, Sept 30, at 1pm EST. We’re thrilled to be able to expand on our offer from last year. The voucher can now be used for either the Foundations exam OR the Copilot exam.

Note that GitHub has moved to a different system, Microsoft Learn and Pearson VUE in order to deliver the exams.

The voucher can be used 1 time
Voucher is valid for either the Foundations Exam OR the Copilot Exam. Not both.
All certifications earned through PSI (before July 1, 2025) will remain visible in your GitHub Learn profile. All certifications earned through Pearson VUE (on or after July 1, 2025) will appear in your Microsoft Learn profile.
