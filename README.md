## 🎓 Branch Practice Exercises

Complete the following exercises in order. Each one builds on the previous step and introduces new Git concepts.

### Exercise 1: Create Your First Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch with your name
git checkout -b feature/your-name-introduction

# Or alternatively (two-step approach)
git branch feature/your-name-introduction
git checkout feature/your-name-introduction

# Verify you're on the new branch (should show your branch name)
git branch
```
**What's happening:** You're creating an isolated space to work without affecting the main codebase.

### Exercise 2: Make Your First Changes
1. Open the `student-introductions.md` file
2. Add your introduction following the template provided
3. Include your name, GitHub username, and a brief bio (2-3 sentences)
4. Save the file when complete

**Tip:** You can also practice with `practice-file.md` to experiment without affecting the main file.

### Exercise 3: Stage and Commit Changes
```bash
# Check what files have changed (shows modified files in red)
git status

# Add your changes to staging area
git add student-introductions.md

# Or add all changes at once
git add .

# Commit your changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add introduction for [Your Name]"

# View your commit in the history
git log --oneline -n 5
```
**What's happening:** You're creating a "snapshot" of your changes with a message describing what you did.

### Exercise 4: Push Your Branch
```bash
# Push your branch to your fork on GitHub
git push origin feature/your-name-introduction

# Verify push was successful (you'll see branch name in output)
git branch -vv
```
**Note:** If this is your first push, GitHub may require authentication. Follow the prompts to set up SSH or use a personal access token.

**What's happening:** You're uploading your branch and changes to your GitHub fork so it's available online.

### Exercise 5: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your fork on GitHub (github.com/your-username/Github-for-beginners)
2. You'll see a prompt to create a Pull Request (or switch to your branch and click "Compare & pull request")
3. Add a clear title: `"Add [Your Name] introduction"`
4. In the description, write:
   - What you've added
   - Why you're making this change
   - Any relevant links or references
5. Click **"Create pull request"**
6. Wait for the maintainers to review your changes!

**What's happening:** You're proposing your changes to the original project. The maintainers can review, discuss, and merge your work.
